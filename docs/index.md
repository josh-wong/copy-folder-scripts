# ðŸš§remove-folder and copy-folder scriptsðŸš§

> **Warning**

> This script only runs properly if the destination (dest) path doesn't already exist. If the folder with the same name exists, this script will not run properly. 

The **remove-folder** and **copy-folder** scripts can be used to automate the process of copying files from one folder into another folder on Windows.ðŸ¤–

- **remove-folder script:** Deletes the existing folder specified in the script. The folder name you want to delete should match the name of the folder you want to copy in the **copy-folder** script.
- **copy-folder script:** Copies the folder specified in the script to the location specified in the script.

To automate this script, you can add a task in Task Scheduler in Windows. For details on using Task Scheduler, please see [Task Scheduler for developers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/taskschd/task-scheduler-start-page).
